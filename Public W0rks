Name: Public W0rks
Purpose: To give power to the people to identify, discuss, and incentivize major infrastructure projects of greatest benefit at a local, national, or even global level and to do so with full public transparency.
Description: An online interchange where people can identify, discuss, and vote on the most desired public infrastructure projects on local, national, and even global levels. Initially, this could lead to a better informed list of priorities for government. As the district scales, the system could grow to incentivize, with start-up funding, grass-roots groups and private-sector professionals to develop and implement the most desired  infrastructure proposals, all with full public transparency.
